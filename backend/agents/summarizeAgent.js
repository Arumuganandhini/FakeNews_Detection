// agents/summarizeAgent.js
//
// Short summary of a news article.
//
// History of this file, because it explains the shape of the code:
//
//   1. Originally it ran at the 0.7 default temperature with no caching, so the
//      same article summarised differently on every page load.
//   2. It also demanded "5-10 sentences" regardless of input. The news feed
//      truncates bodies to roughly 200 characters, so the model filled the gap
//      by inventing — differently each run. That produced the contradictions.
//   3. The fix for (2) was a prompt with explicit rules. The model in use is a
//      reasoning model, and it narrated those rules back into its answer:
//      "We need to summarize the news text in 1-2 sentences... So we can
//      summarize: ...". A tight token budget then cut the real summary off
//      mid-sentence.
//
// So the answer is not requested as free text at all. It is requested as a JSON
// field, which the shared extractor pulls out no matter what the model writes
// around it, and the budget is generous enough to hold the model's thinking as
// well as the answer.
const { callNimApiJson } = require('../utils/nvidiaNimApi');

// Phrases that mean the model narrated instead of answering. If one survives
// into the extracted field, the summary is not usable.
const REASONING_LEAK = /^\s*(we (need|must|should|can)\b|let me\b|first,? I\b|the text (is|appears)\b|okay,?\s|so we\b|i('| a)m going to\b)/i;

  // The key is DESCRIBED, not shown as a template.
  //
  // Constrained JSON decoding and a placeholder schema do not mix. Given
  // `{"summary": "<the summary, as plain prose>"}` in JSON mode, the model
  // returned a bare `{}` on every attempt — valid JSON, no summary, and the
  // page showed "Failed to analyze summary. Please try again." Asked in words
  // for an object with one key called "summary", the same model answered
  // correctly every time. The difference is the template: with the structure
  // already supplied and the only slot a placeholder, closing the object is a
  // valid completion.

Cover only what the text actually says. If it breaks off mid-story, summarise the part that is there — do not continue the story yourself.

Return a JSON object with exactly one key, "summary", whose value is that summary as a plain-prose string.

Text:
"""
${text}
"""`;

  // The budget has to hold the model's own reasoning as well as the answer;
  // the answer is read out of the JSON field, so extra thinking is harmless.
