// A note on professional fact-check matching
// ------------------------------------------
// A seventh factor matched an article's claims against verdicts published by
// professional fact-checkers. It is no longer part of the pipeline. Both routes
// to that evidence proved impractical here:
//
//   - Google's Fact Check Tools API requires a billing-enabled account.
//   - Reading ClaimReview markup off fact-checkers' own pages works, but the
//     only way to find the right page is the news search, and the free news tier
//     allows 100 requests a day in total — a budget the article feed and
//     cross-source verification already depend on.
//
// Searching the fact-checkers directly was tested and does not work: their
// search pages render results in JavaScript, so there is nothing to read.
//
// agents/factCheckAgent.js and utils/claimReviewReader.js are kept, working and
// unwired, for anyone who has a Fact Check Tools key — re-adding the import, a
// weight below, and the factor entry is all it takes. See the README.

// Factor weights.
//
// Only the five presentation factors are combined by weight; they are
// renormalised among themselves at the point of use. `verification` keeps a
// weight here because the evaluation harness and the archived results refer to
// it, but the running pipeline no longer adds it to the sum: evidence sets the
// ceiling instead of contributing a term. See the channel split below.
//
// Bumped whenever the shape of a report changes — a new factor, a renamed
// field, a different scale. Cached reports below the current version are
// re-analysed instead of served, so an upgrade can never leave a reader
// looking at a report built by an older pipeline. Cache entries written before
// versioning existed have no version at all and are treated as stale.
