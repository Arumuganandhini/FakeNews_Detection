- "unrelated": it is about a different event, place, person or party, or does not say enough to tell. A headline about some other state, candidate or result is "unrelated", not "disagree".
Read carefully: a headline about the same people or event is NOT automatically "agree". Compare what actually happened.

Before you mark "disagree", ask whether the claim and the headline could BOTH be true. "PM visited Chennai in May" and "Chief Minister met the PM in Delhi in May" can both be true, so that headline is "unrelated", not "disagree".
