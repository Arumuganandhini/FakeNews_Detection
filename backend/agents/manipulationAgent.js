// The taxonomy follows the propaganda-technique literature — SemEval-2020
// Task 11 (Detection of Propaganda Techniques in News Articles) — reduced to
// the techniques that appear most often in mainstream reporting and that a
// non-expert reader can recognise once they are named.
//
// This is a span-level task: each detection must quote the text it applies to,
// so the reader can see the technique in the article's own words.

Techniques to look for:
${catalogue}

Rules:
- Quote the text EXACTLY as it appears — never paraphrase.
- Only report a technique when it is clearly present. Straightforward factual reporting uses none, and an empty list is the correct answer for such an article.
- Report each distinct instance once. At most 3, the clearest ones.

Return a JSON object with these keys:
- "intensity": one of none, light, moderate, heavy.
- "techniques": an array, empty when the article uses none. Each entry has "technique" (one of: ${TECHNIQUE_NAMES.join(', ')}), "quote" (the exact wording from the article) and "effect" (one short sentence on what it does to the reader).
- "summary": one sentence describing how the article addresses its reader.` + languageDirective(language);
