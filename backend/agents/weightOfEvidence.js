// What the score is, and why it is that and not something else.
//
// THE PROBLEM WITH THE OLD SCORE
//
// The previous rule was `0.15·source + 0.10·headline + 0.15·bias + ...`, which
// has two defects that no amount of tuning repairs.
//
//   1. The constants were chosen by hand. "Why 0.18 for transparency?" has no
//      answer. A system that tells a reader whether to believe a news story
//      should not rest on numbers that somebody liked the look of.
//
//   2. The output meant nothing. What IS 6.4 out of 10? Not a probability, not
//      a frequency, not a rate. It had no referent outside our own code, so it
//      could be neither verified nor falsified.
//
// WHAT REPLACES IT
//
// The output is P(fabricated | evidence): a probability, which is checkable
// against reality. If the system says 0.7 on a hundred articles, about seventy
// of them should be fabricated, and that is measurable.
//
// It is reached by accumulating evidence, not by averaging scores. Each
// observation contributes a likelihood ratio,
//
//     LR = P(observation | fabricated) / P(observation | genuine)
//
// estimated from labelled data by eval/estimateWeights.js — measured, not
// chosen. Ratios combine as log-odds, reported in decibans (10·log10 LR) after
// I. J. Good, because decibans ADD: the final number is an auditable sum whose
// terms can each be printed, argued with, and traced to the articles that
// produced them.
//
// Three properties fall out of this that the weighted mean could not provide:
//
//   * An uninformative factor contributes EXACTLY nothing. LR = 1 is 0 decibans.
//     Abstention stops being a special case in the code and becomes arithmetic.
//   * A factor nobody has measured contributes nothing, rather than a number
//     someone invented. Absence of evidence produces absence of weight.
//   * Evidence is non-compensatory in the right way: a factor that genuinely
//     separates the classes swamps one that does not, because that is what its
//     measured ratio says, not because we told it to.
//
// WHAT IS STILL DECLARED RATHER THAN MEASURED
//
// Honesty about this matters more than the appearance of rigour. The priors and
// the corroboration rates in data/evidenceWeights.json are DECLARED parameters:
// stated openly, with justification, and marked as such in every report. They
// are measurable, and the scripts to measure them exist; until they are run,
// the system says so rather than implying an estimate it does not have.
