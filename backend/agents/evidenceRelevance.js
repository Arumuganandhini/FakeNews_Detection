// Is this retrieved article actually about the claim?
//
// The language model is asked a narrow question — does this coverage support or
// contradict the claim — and it answers willingly even when the coverage is
// about something else. A fabricated story about a "secret chemical leak" and an
// "overnight evacuation" retrieves real articles about some other evacuation
// somewhere else, and the model reports the claim as supported. The verdict then
// says "likely true" about an invented event, which is the most damaging error
// this system can make.
//
// The fix is not a better prompt. It is a check the model does not get to make:
// evidence only counts if it mentions what the claim is about. Distinctive terms
// — names, places, numbers, uncommon words — must be shared between the claim and
// the evidence's own headline. This is deterministic, costs nothing, and is
// applied after the model has spoken, so the model cannot argue with it.
