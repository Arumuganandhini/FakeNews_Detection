// backend/eval/estimateWeights.js
//
// Where the weights come from.
//
// The previous scoring rule multiplied each factor by a constant — 0.15 for
// source, 0.10 for headline, 0.18 for transparency — and those constants were
// chosen by hand. There is no defence of that. Ask "why 0.18?" and the honest
// answer is "it looked about right", which is not a basis for telling a reader
// whether to believe a news story.
//
// This script replaces the question. Instead of asking how much a factor should
// count, it measures how much a factor's observed value actually distinguishes
// a fabricated article from a genuine one, on labelled data:
//
//     LR(observation) = P(observation | fabricated) / P(observation | genuine)
//
// A likelihood ratio of 1 means the observation is equally common in both
// classes — it carries no information, and it contributes nothing. A ratio of 4
// means the observation is four times more likely in a fabricated article. These
// ratios are what the running system uses; they are estimated here, written to
// data/evidenceWeights.json, and versioned with the counts they came from, so any
// number the system uses can be traced to the articles that produced it.
//
// Weight of evidence is reported in decibans, W = 10·log10(LR), after I. J. Good
// and the Bletchley Park usage: decibans ADD, which is what makes the final
// score an auditable sum rather than an opaque blend.
//
// Two safeguards, because a small sample will happily produce enormous ratios:
//
//   1. Conservative bound. Each weight is shrunk toward zero by its own 95%
//      confidence interval, so the system never claims more evidence than the
//      data supports. A bin with three articles in it ends up contributing
//      nothing, which is correct.
//   2. Correlation damping. Bias, persuasion and clickbait measure overlapping
//      things; adding their weights independently counts the same evidence
//      several times. The effective number of independent factors is computed
//      from the observed correlation matrix and the family's total weight is
//      scaled accordingly.
//
// Usage:
//   node eval/estimateWeights.js                       # uses every labelled run it can find
//   node eval/estimateWeights.js --input path.jsonl    # a specific run
