 * Who may call the analysis endpoints.
 *
 * Every one of them spends something scarce: the news index allows 100 requests
 * a day for the whole application, and each analysis makes several, plus the
 * model calls. They used to be open to anyone who could reach the server —
 * the pages that call them require a login, but the endpoints themselves did
 * not, so a script pointed at the deployed backend could exhaust the day's
 * quota before a single reader arrived. They now require what the pages
 * already send: a signed-in reader's token.
 *
 * The evaluation scripts drive the same endpoints over HTTP. They present
 * INTERNAL_API_KEY instead, which exists only in the server's own .env; when
 * that variable is unset, the key route is closed and only a login works.
